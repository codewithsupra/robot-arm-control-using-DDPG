 In this project, we will experiment and compare
the efficiency among different popular algorithms in
reinforcement learning. This would not only help us grasp a
general view of these algorithms but also further convince
us of how the potentials reinforcement learning would be in
the near future. Reinforcement learning offers to robotics a
framework and set of tools for the design of sophisticated
and hard-to-engineer behaviours

We first build a training framework.
An environment is created for the agent to work upon .
Reinforcement learning method is used to train the agent to reach the object wherever it is placed
Optimizing and debugging is done whenever needed.
